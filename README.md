# Chlorine

Cl + Atom = Chlorine

Socket-REPL integration with Clojure and ClojureScript with Atom.

## Usage

As with proto-repl, Cider, and others, you need to fire up a REPL in the console, then
connect it with Atom. If you're using Clojure, it'll use the wonderful UnREPL project
to send and receive commands.

## TODO
